# :fire: Prometheus
## Description
Prometheus is a Lua obfuscator written in pure Lua.

This Project was inspired by the amazing [javascript-obfuscator](https://github.com/javascript-obfuscator/javascript-obfuscator).   
It can currently obfuscate Lua51 and Roblox's LuaU, however LuaU support is not finished yet.
